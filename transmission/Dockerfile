# Small hack needed for ingress support
#
# Transmission always uses "transmission" as a subdirectory in the URL, so the web interface can for instance be found at:
#
#   http://<server>/transmission/web/
#
# The same goes for the RPC API, which is exposed under /transmission/rpc. When using ingress, this is not the case however
# and "transmission" directory is not part of the URL. So transmission is basically served under the root (/), e.g.:
#
#   http://10.0.10.110:8123/api/hassio_ingress/rQEi5X4zJFTmZ82ghplDjsx2AoK3r2lqx0zZHHjZ69Q/
#
# As the web UI uses a relative path when resolving the RPC endpoint, it basically becomes:
#
#   http://10.0.10.110:8123/api/hassio_ingress/rQEi5X4zJFTmZ82ghplDjsx2AoK3r2lqx0zZHHjZ69Q/../rpc
#
# which obviously is:
#
#   http://10.0.10.110:8123/api/hassio_ingress
#
# This will not work. The sed statement below changes the way the RPC endpoint is determined by keeping the regular endpoint
# when accessing transmission as usual, but stripping the relative part when using ingress.
